   <h2>Navigation Bar Design Process</h2>
   
   <p> To make my navigation bar, I decided to do a horizontal bar that extended across the top of my homepage. I knew I wanted to make a dropdown menu with all my assignments, and it made the most sense to do it horizontally for all the assignments to show up nicely in a drop down menu. So, I went to W3Schools online and used their code for the "Dropdown Navbar", adding in my own values for my different tabs, color of the menu and links to my different assignments. The code that I recycled from W3Schools essentially provided the fluid layout, and I merely adjusted and customized according to my needs. </p>
   
   <h2>Why Yellow?</h2>
   
   <p> I decided to make the color of my navigation bar a shade of my signature color to really emphasize that YELLOW is my color and also use my color as another element on my page. </p>
   
   <p> I would like to name my signature color "Mama Duck Yellow", because mama ducks are my spirit animals. I love the color yellow because it is bright, warm and full of life. I think that this name for my signature color - "Mama Duck Yellow" - would embody me and my personality as a motherly figure to my peers and friends and also symbolize my appreciation for life and its many blessings. </p>
