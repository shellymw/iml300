            I believe that Medium is an example of a website with good typography because the colors are bold and eyecatching, but not overpowering. The fonts are clear, modern and simple. My eyes can read the text easily and it's aesthetically pleasing.

            This website is just so ugly I can't even comprehend. My senses feel like they are being violated. The fonts are all over the place, there are ugly pictures and absolutely no color scheme. The fonts are incredibly basic and there is no organization for the eyes to follow.
