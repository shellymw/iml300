            I really like Urban ThinkTank's website because the home page is so dynamic and minimalistic at the same time. The background is a moving slideshow of videos and photos of urban spaces, slightly faded so it doesn't take too much attention away from the introductory text. I like the font and the size of their mission statement on the home page and like the side menu that clearly outlines the different tabs that they have. The "About" page is clearly organized into sections with interesting member photos and easy-to-read text.

          Ling's Cars' website is a classic example of a website with bad layout. The website has so much "stuff" on it that my eyes don't know where to look. The blinking animations and shocking, contrasting colors overwhelm my eyes because it's too much all at once. I don't know how to navigate myself through the website and the content is not well structured or easy-to-read.
